/// {@category Domain}
/// This file defines a Production class using Freezed and JsonSerializable annotations.
/// The Production class represents a production with properties for various details such as owner UID, part name,
/// transitory farming ID, creation date, unit of measurement, quantity, price, total value, and ID.
/// It is designed to be immutable and provides methods for JSON serialization and deserialization.
/// This file includes both the definition of the Production class and the generated code for JSON serialization/deserialization.
/// Freezed annotations are used to generate constructors and equality checks for the class, while JsonSerializable annotations
/// are used to generate toJson() and fromJson() methods for serialization and deserialization.
